# Integration of generative language AIs for feedback generation in the autograder CodeOcean 

## This is a placeholder for code used for this Research Project.

### There are two methods of Implementation

* First Method is to integrate AI into the code ocean backend the code for this can be found in the [path](https://github.com/seemantTUI/AutoGraderCodeOcen/tree/master/lib/code_ocean)
* Second method is to integrate AI into the exercise. For this example Python is used and the code for exercise along with chatGPT can be found in the [path](https://github.com/seemantTUI/AutoGraderCodeOcen/tree/master/lib/demo_python_excersise)
